# create-your-own-react
After coding a long with the [build your own react article](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/), I added some notes and console logs to help visualize the react lifecycle. 

## Setup

To install the project:
```
npm i
```


Build and server the application: 

```
npm run start
```
